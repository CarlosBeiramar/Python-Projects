# Birthday Reminder Notifier

Meet the Birthday Reminder Notifier, your friendly sidekick that's got your back, making sure you never miss a friend's birthday bash again!

## How it works:

For this program to function, you need a JSON file containing your friends' birthdays (day and month) along with their names. Additionally, users must have a Twilio account set up. Once the code runs, it automatically checks the JSON file, identifies friends whose birthdays match the current date, and sends the user a message listing the friend(s) celebrating their birthday that day.

This approach ensures you stay connected with your friends and never miss a birthday celebration, all thanks to automated reminders sent directly to your phone through Twilio.

## How to run:

```
python3 main.py
```
